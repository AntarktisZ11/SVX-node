# SA6MBO SVX-node
A basic UHF or VHF node designed around a SA868 fitted as a HAT on top of an [Orange Pi Zero LTS](http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-Zero-LTS.html "Orange Pi Zero LTS"). The repeater software is the [SVXLink project](https://github.com/sm0svx/svxlink "SVXLink project") with configuration inspired by the [ROLink community](http://www.439100.ro/ "ROLink community"). The origin of this project is courtesy of [SM6TZL](https://svxportal.sm2ampr.net/station_info.php?callsign=SM6TZL&no_header=true "SM6TZL")'s small mobile unit. A massive praise goes to VoltLogs [VoltNode](https://github.com/voltlog/VoltNode "VoltNode") for comprising the work into a manageable PCB along with short but good documentation.
